\newcommand{\projectAbstract}{
The basis of this project is optimising the route planning aspect and perimeter delimitation of an autonomous robotic lawn mower, and trying to develop a better solution than the currently most used route technology. The general problem in this report is therefore trying to optimize the perimeter delimitation and mowing pattern aspects of the route planning. The problem and possible solutions is analysed and compared to solutions currently on the market, and simulations and construction of a prototype is used to evaluate these possible solutions. Through these simulations the planned routing algorithm developed in the project is shown to create a route with a shorter length to mow the entire lawn, than the simulation of a random route. The perimeter delimitation and drive handling of the mower is developed using \glsentryshort{dgps}. With a precision of less than \SI{10}{\centi\meter} this solution is shown to be applicable.
