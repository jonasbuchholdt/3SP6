\subsection{Equalizing}
The audible frequency can be separated into octaves, witch is a interval between center frequency, where the frequency is the half or the double in one octave separation. Frequently by some well known company as Dolby lake \citep{lab_gruppen_eq}, now owned by Music group and Powersoft \citep{powersoft_eq}, the frequency of an equalizer is separated by third of an octave. 
The \gls{eq} effect is done with a bank of bandpass filters using third octave separation from \SI{20}{\hertz} to \SI{20}{\kilo\hertz} which are divided by a fixed frequency distance but the octave order can be changed in advance systems. The analog \gls{eq} has a fixed distance which mostly keep the octave standard while the digital equalizer can be more flexible octave order and sometime has customized frequency distance. This bandpass filter is able to either amplify or attenuate the gain of the specified frequency. The \autoref{fig:analog_equalizer} shows an analog \gls{eq} with traditional third octave separation \citep{nordic}

\todo[inline]{Mohamed : Maybe add why they will affect each other}
One amplified bandpass filter will interfere with the other neighboring filters, thus the frequency response will be different than what can be expected with ideal filters on the analog equalizer output. The following \autoref{fig:analog_equalizer_respond} shows the analog frequency response of the above analog \gls{eq} \autoref{fig:analog_equalizer}.

A simple block diagram of a \gls{eq}  is showing at the following \autoref{fig:equalizer_block}.

The interference effects on the side lying bandpass filter can easily be avoided by using an digital equalizer with third-octave raised cosine characteristics. The difference between the  bandpass filter characteristics and the one with a raised-cosine are shown in \autoref{fig:raised_cosine_vs_traditional}

\begin{figure} [htbp]

  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{raised_cosine_vs_traditional}

  }
  \label{fig:raised_cosine_vs_traditional}
\end{figure}



When using third-octave raised cosine bandpass filter, it is possible to make an equalizer where neighboring filters do not interfere with each other, because a raised cosine filter does not leak into other third-octave bands like the traditional filter does. With this kind of filter it is possible to make a perfectly flat frequency response, and it is very close to an ideal equalizer. The \autoref{fig:raised_cosine_respond} shows the frequency response of a third-octave raised cosine equalizer designed by Dolby lake with the same gain and frequency settings as the analog equalizer at \autoref{fig:analog_equalizer}.

The equalizer is used to compensate for the changes in sound due to different room characteristics, because the sound can be completely different in different rooms. The room characteristics will or can amplify or attenuate some frequency, and therefore the equalizer is very important to adjust the frequency in every new room.\citep{howtogeek}
