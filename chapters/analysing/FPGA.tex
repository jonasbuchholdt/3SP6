\section{FPGA}


The FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) is an integrated circuits that contains multiple logic blocks and routing channels.
The hardware configuration is customizable in order to meet the user’s demands; unlike ICs where the connections between the transistors cannot be changed, it is possible to make a custom architecture on an FPGA.
The biggest advantage of the FPGA is to make multiple processes at the same time, which is not the case in the ICs. If task needs to be done in a restricted timing, this parameter can be crucial.

FPGA are rather preferred over DSPs for digital signal processing when a high sample rate is needed. A normal DSP is designed to perform a specific task but can have limitations in the number of tasks that can be done per second. In today’s world, demands are increasing faster than the development of DSPs which means in many cases a single DSP is no longer efficient. One solution is to use multiple DSPs but architecture is more complex and an implementation of this type is not cost efficient. Using multiple devices forces the programmer to code some scheduling algorithms in order to achieve what is wanted which adds more overhead on the machine. 
In order to further understand why an FPGA is more efficient than the traditional DSP, the two modules need to be further explained.
