\section{Quality}

The bandwidth in an analog sound signal can be increased infinitely unlike the digital one where it is limited by the sampling rate that has been used. 
The Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) is higher in digital signals than analog ones because of their low bit depth. The bit depth is a variable that takes into account the change in amplitude between each sample. If the sample rate is not high enough in digital signal, the SNR is higher \citep{analog_quality}.
