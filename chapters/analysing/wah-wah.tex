\section{Wah-Wah}

The effect takes the original signal and mix it with the signal after passing through a bandpass filter. The bandpass filter is time varying, which means that it changes its position in the frequency spectrum. \\
Different parameters can be changed on the \gls{lfo} to customize the effect:\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{The \gls{lfo} frequency}: it sets the speed at which the bandpass filter moves in the frequency spectrum.
	\item \textbf{\gls{lfo} start phase}: Determine where should the bandpass filter start.
	\item \textbf{\gls{lfo} depth} : the range of frequencies it should work on, high depth gives a bigger range and vice versa.
\end{itemize}
