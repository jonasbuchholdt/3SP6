The effect takes the original signal and mix it with the signal after passing through a bandpass filter. The bandpass filter is time varying, which means that it changes its position in the frequency spectrum. \\
Different parameters can be changed on the LFO to customize the effect:\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{The LFO frequency}: it sets the speed at which the bandpass filter moves in the frequency spectrum.
	\item \textbf{LFO start phase}: Determine where should the bandpass filter start.
	\item \textbf{LFO depth} : the range of frequencies it should work on, high depth gives a bigger range and vice versa.
\end{itemize}
