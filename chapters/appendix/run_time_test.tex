\chapter{Test of effect run time}\label{app:effect_run_time}

The tests of the time needed to run effects are presented in this appendix.

\section*{Materials and setup}
To measure the time consumption of each effect, the following materials are used:
\begin{itemize}
\item Digilent Analog Discovery 2 (Oscilloscope)
\item Digilent Waveforms 2015 (PC - software)
\item Ezdsp board
\end{itemize}

\section*{Test procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The materials are set up as in \autoref{fig:run_time_test_point}.
\item The Digilent Waveform 2015 is set as a Scope.
\item  The XF led bit is set at the beginning of the program and cleared in the end of the program, in the mainas file, see example \autoref{code:mainas_asm}. The time from when the LED is being illuminated until it is turned off is the runtime, also measured using the magnitude as shown in \autoref{fig:run_time_test_point}. 
\item  The Scope is then used to measure the XF LED runtime 
\item The data is plotted in MATLAB.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Reverb run time}
The following \autoref{fig:reverb_time_test} shows the measurement results of the \gls{reverb} assembly program runtime.

\end{figure}

According to \autoref{fig:reverb_time_test}, the \gls{reverb} runtime is \SI{2.25}{\micro\second}

\section*{Cordic run time}
The following \autoref{fig:cordic_time_test} shows the measurement results of the cordic assembly program runtime.
\begin{figure}[htbp!]

		\caption{The figure shows the runtime of the cordic assembly program}
		\label{fig:cordic_time_test}
\end{figure}

According to \autoref{fig:cordic_time_test}, the cordic runtime is \SI{1.3}{\micro\second}
