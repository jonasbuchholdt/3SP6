\section{Design of the Chorus and Flanger Effect}

\subsection{Obtaining the Differential Equation}

The flanger- and chorus- effect are similar in their design so they will be presented in the same section. \\

From the block diagram presented in section \autoref{sec:chorus}, a block diagram in the discrete time domain for the flanger and chorus effect can be obtained and is shown in \autoref{fig:chorus_diag_des}. \\ 
The chorus effect is the one in red and black while the flanger is only in black.

From \autoref{fig:chorus_diag_des}, the following differential equations can be inferred:

The equation for the flanger can be written as in \autoref{eq:flang_eq}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:flang_eq}
		y[n] = x[n] + x[n- d_{1}] \cdot g_{1}  
\end{equation}

The equation for the chorus can be written as in \autoref{eq:chor_eq}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:chor_eq}
y[n] = x[n] + \sum_{j=1}^{i}  (x[n- d_{j}] \cdot g_{j})
\end{equation}

The index $i$ represents the number of delays that are being implemented in the chorus effect which is also the chorus size. Index $n$ represents the present sample. \\
If the implementation is done using a time varying delay, equations \ref{flang_eq} and \ref{chor_eq} can be re-written as \autoref{eq:flang_eq2} and \autoref{eq:chor_eq2}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:flang_eq2}
y[n] = x[n] + x[n- d_{1}[n]] \cdot g_{1}  
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:chor_eq2}
y[n] = x[n] + \sum_{j=1}^{i}  (x[n- d_{j}[n]] \cdot g_{j})
\end{equation}

The delay value has to be a periodic function that is varying in a user-defined range. As illustrated in \autoref{fig:chorus_diag_des}, this varying delay can be made from a \gls{lfo}.

The LFO that makes the delay varies is a sine wave in the chorus and the flanger effect. In the case of the flanger, the user can set the LFO frequency between 0,1 and 10 Hz and only the boundaries for the chorus. \\

The gain for the flanger effect can be chosen by the user. For the chorus, the user can choose the boundaries of the gain value that will be randomly selected for each of the delay lines. \\

The number of delay lines for the chorus effect is also a choice but should not exceed 4, the reason is that after 4 lines it has been found that the effect has a strange sound. \\

The delay time for the flanging effect should be between 1 and 20 ms while the delay time in the chorus should be longer than 20ms. \\

From the difference equation, it can be seen that the design is using a FIR Comb filter but where the delay value varies. \todo[inline]{Why is it FIR comb filter?}

\subsection{Making the LFO by Cordic algorithm}
The \gls{lfo} in both the chorus- and the flanger- effect is, as stated in \autoref{}, should be able to make sine waves from \SI{0.1}{\kilo\hertz} to \SI{10}{\kilo\hertz}. A \gls{dsp} is not necessarily able to calculate sine values and therefore an algorithm has to be implemented in order to make this possible. A way to do this is by using the \gls{cordic} algorithm, which can be used to calculate both sine, cosine, square roots etc \citep{cordic}. 
The idea of \gls{cordic} is to use pseudo rotations round the unitcircle to approximate the desired angle and the thereby finding the sine and cosine of the angle. When using the real rotation, and not the pseudo rotations, cosine and sine to an angle is found by \autoref{eq:cordic_x} and \autoref{eq:cordic_y}, which is also illustrated in \autoref{fig:cordic_ro_pseudo_ro}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cordic_x}
		x' = x \cdot \cos(\theta) - y \cdot \cdot \sin(\theta) 
\end{equation}

     \explain{$x'$ is the first coordinate to the vector with length 1 and angle $\theta$.}{\si{1}}
     \explain{$x$ is the first coordinate of the start vector (Initialized to 1).}{\si{1}}
     \explain{$y$ is the second coordinate of the start vector (Initialized to 0).}{\si{1}}
    \stopexplain 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cordic_y}
		y' = y \cdot \cos(\theta) + x \cdot \sin(\theta) 
\end{equation}
\startexplain
     \explain{$y'$ is the second coordinate to the vector with length 1 and angle $\theta$.}{\si{1}}

The aim of the \gls{cordic} is to reduce the calculations so they only contain additions, multiplications and bit shifts. 



\subsection{Matlab Simulation}

A delay can be done in different ways digitally. One way is to use a ring buffer also known as circular buffer. \\
The idea of this data structure is that it takes values and only outputs them when it gets full, and overwrites the oldest after outputting it. It is a kind of a FIFO queue structure but where the start and the overwriting can start at any index. \\
This means that the size of the buffer depends on the delay.  The buffer size must then be always up-to-date with the new delay value. \\ 
The value of the delay is determined by a periodic function as said before, different waveforms can be used as said in \autoref{chor_flang}. A common periodic function that can be used is the sine. Since it varies between 0 and 1, it can be then multiplied with the user-defined range. 
The delay can then be written as:

\begin{equation}
	d[n]= A \cdot sin(2\pi  \cdot \frac{f_{l}}{f_{s}} n)
\end{equation}

\startexplain
     \explain{$A$ is the value of the user-defined range which is also the depth.}{\si{1}}
     \explain{$f_{s}$ the sampling frequency.}{\si{\hertz}}
     \explain{$f_{l}$ is the frequency of the \gls{lfo}.}{\si{\hertz}}
