\chapter{Module: Drive Train}\label{ch:drivetrain}
In this chapter, the highlighted modules in the drive train in \autoref{fig:modular_drive_train} are constructed. The electrical motor is chosen and the hardware is designed.

e model of the lawn mower is divided into three parts. Each motor has its own controller and there is one controller for speed and angle combined. Since the motor and the gearing are identical for the two motors, only one controller will be developed, and afterwards copied, to give each motor its own.
