\label{ch:disinit}
In this chapter the \gls{dsp} initializing will be designed. This include \gls{adc}, \gls{dac} and sound in and out. All the \gls{dsp} initializing will be written C and the audio in and out will be written in assembly. 

\section{Sample frequency}
In this section the sample frequency will be designed and initialized to the \gls{dsp} in C. \citep{slaa557}
On the TMS320C5515 eZdsp USB Stick there is a \gls{dsp} with an external stereo \gls{adc} and \gls{dac} TLV320AIC3204 Ultra Low Power Stereo Audio Codec \citep{TLV320AIC3204}. The initializing is done by written the initializing code on the \gls{dsp} and afterwards transfer the data through an $I^2C$ connection. The audio data is afterwards transferred with an $I^2S$ connection between the \gls{dsp} and the TLV320AIC3204 chip.
The following \autoref{code:dsp_reset} is made to reset the TLV320AIC3204 chip.

\includeCode{aic3204_init.c}{c}{12}{13}{The \gls{adc}/\gls{dac} reset code}{code:dsp_reset}{code/design/}

Afterwards the clock shall be designed and and initialized. It is chosen that the \gls{dsp} shall be as fast as possible, so it is possible to run more than one effect in serial. In according to \citep{slaa557} the initializing with \SI{44.1}{\kilo\hertz} shall be initialized as following \autoref{tab:fs_clk} with an master clock from the dsp at \SI{12}{\mega\hertz}

\begin{table}[]

\caption{tab:fs_clk}
\label{tab:fs_clk}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
\multicolumn{6}{|l|}{$f_s=44.1kHz$}           \\ \hline
MCLK (MHz) & PLLP & PLLR & PLLJ & PLLD & MADC \\ \hline
12         & 1    & 1    & 7    & 560  & 3    \\ \hline
NADC       & AOSR & MDAC & NDAC & DOSR &      \\ \hline
5          & 128  & 3    & 5    & 128  &      \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


The TLV320AIC3204 chip is then with following C code  \autoref{code:dsp_init}.
