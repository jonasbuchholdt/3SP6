\section{Digital Signal Processor Choice}

There are many advantages to choose a \gls{dsp} over an FPGA in this project. 

The first one is the simplicity of designing with a \gls{dsp} due to the availability of all the simple functionalities in a micro-controller. \\

\gls{dsp} is designed to perform signal processing task unlike the FPGA which is purpose of creation was not related to signal processing but to program circuits. \\

According to different sources, a \gls{dsp} is more suitable in terms of cost/performance for an MMAC lower than 3000, which means that it is better for low demanding applications. \\

Additionally, FPGAs lack integrated DAC and ADC. \\
