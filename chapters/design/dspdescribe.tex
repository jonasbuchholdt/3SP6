\section{Description of the chosen DSP}

The chosen DSP is the Texas Instruments TMS320C5515 Fixed-Point Digital Signal Processor.

\subsection{Power}

The DSP processor gets its power from the \gls{usb} connection.

\subsection{Different Ports}

The C5515 features multiple ports and connectors. It has a micro SD connector, an expansion edge connector as well as a two \gls{usb}s. It also has an audio IN and two Bluetooth. \\

Each USB connector has a different role, one is used for software purposes and the other one to connect to the personal computer. 

\subsection{LCD Screen}

The \gls{dsp} processor has also an LCD screen that can print different characters by using a string of 14 pins. 

\subsection{Interface with the User}

The processor contains two switch buttons that can be integrated in the software to create an action. 

\subsection{Expansion}

\subsection{Monitoring and Testing}

Several "Test points" are available in order to see the signals' behavior moving in the \gls{dsp} processor.
