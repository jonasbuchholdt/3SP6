\section{Pre-amplifier}
In order to transfer as much signal from the guitar as possible, and avoid some significant voltage division between the guitar and the \gls{dsp} in some frequency area, a \gls{preamp} will be designed. The output impedance of the guitar is measured an the result is shown in ??. This shows that the output impedance for a guitar is not the same from \SI{10}{\hertz} to \SI{22}{\kilo\hertz} and the output impedance is generally very high. Therefore the \gls{preamp} needs to have an very high input impedance to avoid significant voltage division in the frequency area from \SI{10}{\kilo\hertz} to \SI{22}{\kilo\hertz} compared to the frequency area from \SI{10}{\hertz} to \SI{10}{\kilo\hertz}. The input impedance shall therefore be much higher than \SI{73.06}{\kilo\hertz} reff ?? which is the highest measured output impedance on the guitar, to allow as much signal transfer as possible.

\subsection{Component chose}

As seen in the ?? the maximum output signal peak amplitude from the guitar is about \SI{100}{\milli\volt} peak and the standard in ?? says that the signal from a source shall have an voltage \gls{rms} value of \SI{1.768}{\volt} \gls{rms} which is a peak amplitude for \SI{2.5}{\volt} peak. This means that the \gls{preamp} shall have a gain form \SI{0}{\decibel} to \SI{14}{\decibel}, so it is possible to adjust the gain and the \gls{preamp} keeps the standard.
