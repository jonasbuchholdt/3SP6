\section{Initial problem statement}
The following questions are made with the intention, of gathering the necessary knowledge, to be able to answer a later stated problem statement. The initial questions, which will be answered in the analysis, are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Which parameters can be adjusted on an electric guitar, in order to adjust the sound?
\item Which effects can be applied to the signal from an electric guitar and how do they work?
