Based on the knowledge found in the analysis, and the conclusions drawn from it, a problem statement can be made. The following problem statement will be the focus of the rest of the project:
\\
\\
\textbf{How can a number of digital guitar effects be designed and implemented using Digital Signal Processing?}
\section{Delimitations}
The following delimitations are made for the rest of the project:

\begin{itemize}
\item Since the main focus of this project will be to design and digitally implement guitar effects, the design of the analog parts of the project will, as often as possible, be done using \gls{ic}'s. 
\item It is chosen to work with mono audio, since this will be sufficient for the main focus of the project.
\end{itemize}
