\section{Bandpass filter (\reqPrefixName)}
Based on the \autoref{ch:analysing}, the delay requirement is as following

\begin{requirement}\label{req:bandpass_filter}
    \requirement{The delay unit must delay the input signal, in time defined by external unit.}
    \argument{In order to be able to change the delay time, the unit needs to depend on external unit}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:bandpass_filter1}
    \requirement{The delay unit must delay the input signal, in time defined by external unit.}
    \argument{In order to be able to change the delay time, the unit needs to depend on external unit}
\end{requirement}
