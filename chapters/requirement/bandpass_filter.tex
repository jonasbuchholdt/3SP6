\section{Bandpass filter (\reqPrefixName)}
Based on \autoref{ch:analysing}, the bandpass filter unit requirements are as follows:

\begin{requirement}\label{req:bandpass_filter}
    \requirement{The bandpass filter unit must be able to increase the gain in its passband area.}
    \argument{In order to be able to amplify specified frequencies of a signal.}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:bandpass_filter1}
    \requirement{The center frequency must be able to change, defined by an external unit and presets.}
    \argument{In order to be able to change the center frequency in the Wah-Wah effect, and have a preset center frequency in the equalizer.}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:bandpass_filter2}
    \requirement{The bandpass filters must, at full amplification, drop \SI{6}{\decibel} at the neighbouring centerfrequencies .}
    \argument{In order to be able to amplify or attenuate one band, without effect the neighbouring bands.}
\end{requirement}
