\newcommand{\reqbandpass}{The delay unit must delay the input signal, in time defined by external unit.}

\reqPrefix{BF}
\section{Bandpass filter (\reqPrefixName)}
Based on the \autoref{ch:analysing}, the delay requirement is as following

\begin{requirement}\label{req:bandpass_filter}
    \requirement{The bandpass filter unit must be able to increase the gain in its passband area}
    \argument{In order to be able to amplify the the signal gain in specified frequencies}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:bandpass_filter1}
    \requirement{The center frequency must be able to change, defined by an external unit and presets}
    \argument{In order to be able to change the center frequency in Wah-Wah, and have preset center frequency in equalizer}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:bandpass_filter2}
    \requirement{The bandpass filter cross frequency at \SI{0}{\decibel} must be at the previous and the next bandpass center frequency at any gain value}
    \argument{In order to be able to make a flat frequency respond on the amplified frequency}
\end{requirement}
