\section{Basis requirements}
Based on the \autoref{ch:analysing}, the basic requirements are as following

\begin{requirement}\label{req:dsp}
    \requirement{Each unit must be implemented digitally }
    \argument{This requirement is made according to the problem analysis conclusion.}
\end{requirement}


\begin{requirement}\label{req:speed}
    \requirement{All calculations made in one effect shall be faster than the sample frequency. }
    \argument{The processing component shall be fast enough to calculate at least one effect between two samples since they are continuous and not defined in time.}
\end{requirement}
