\section{Basis requirements}
Based on the \autoref{ch:analysing}, the processing component requirements are as following:

\begin{requirement}\label{req:dsp}
    \requirement{The processing component module is used to process the signal }
    \argument{It is concluded that the effects shall be made digitally}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:software}
    \requirement{Each unit must fit into a \gls{dsp} architecture}
    \argument{In order to be able to design all units digitally}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:speed}
    \requirement{The calculation process of one effect shall be faster than the sample frequency. }
    \argument{The processing component shall be fast enough to calculate at least one effect between two sample since the effects are continuous and not defined in time.}
\end{requirement}
