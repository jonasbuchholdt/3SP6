\section{Basis requirements}
Based on the \autoref{ch:analysing}, the delay requirement is as following

\begin{requirement}\label{req:dsp}
    \requirement{Each unit must be implemented digitally }
    \argument{It is concluded that the effect shall be made digitally}
\end{requirement}


\begin{requirement}\label{req:speed}
    \requirement{All calculations made in one effect shall be faster than the sample frequency. }
    \argument{The processing component shall be fast enough to calculate at lest one effect between two sample}
\end{requirement}
