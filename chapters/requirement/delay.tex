\section{Delay}
Based on the \autoref{ch:analysing}, the delay requirement is as following

\begin{requirement}\label{req:delay_ex}
    \requirement{The delay unit must delay the input signal in time defined, by external unit.}
    \argument{In order to be able to control the delay time, from external unit}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:delay_time}
    \requirement{The delay unit must delay the input signal in time, defined by preset mode like the Room- and Hall effect}
    \argument{In order to be able to change the effect mode at the \gls{reverb} unit}
\end{requirement}
