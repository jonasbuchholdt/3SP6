\section{Delay}
Based on the \autoref{ch:analysing}, the delay unit requirements are as following

\begin{requirement}\label{req:delay_ex}
    \requirement{The unit must delay the input signal with defined time, by an external unit.}
    \argument{In order to be able to control the delay time, from external unit}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:delay_time}
    \requirement{The unit must delay the input signal in time, defined by preset mode like the Room and Hall effect}
    \argument{In order to be able to change the effect mode in the \gls{reverb} unit}
\end{requirement}
