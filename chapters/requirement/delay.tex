\reqPrefix{Delay}
\section{Delay}
Based on \autoref{ch:analysing}, the delay unit requirements are as follows:

\begin{requirement}\label{req:delay_ex}
    \requirement{The unit must be able to delay a signal, with the delay time defined by an external unit.}
    \argument{In order to be able to control the delay time from an external unit.}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:delay_time}
    \requirement{The unit must be able to delay a signal, with a predefined delay time.}
    \argument{In order to be able to change the effect mode in the \gls{reverb} effect.}
\end{requirement}
