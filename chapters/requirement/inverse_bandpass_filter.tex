\newcommand{\reqInversebandpassfilter}{The delay unit must delay the input signal, in time defined by external unit.}

\reqPrefix{IBF}
\section{Inverse bandpass filter (\reqPrefixName)}
Based on the \autoref{ch:analysing}, the delay requirement is as following

\begin{requirement}\label{req:Inverse_bandpass_filter_ex}
    \requirement{The inverse bandpass filter unit must be able to attenuate the gain in its stopband area}
    \argument{In order to be able to attenuate the the signal gain in specified frequencies}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:Inverse_bandpass_filter_time}
    \requirement{The center frequency must be defined by internal preset}
    \argument{In order to attenuate the frequency with octave separation in the equalizer}
\end{requirement}
