\section{Inverse bandpass filter (\reqPrefixName)}
Based on the \autoref{ch:analysing}, the inverse bandpass filter requirements are as follows:

\begin{requirement}\label{req:Inverse_bandpass_filter_ex}
    \requirement{The inverse bandpass filter unit must be able to attenuate the gain in its stop-band.}
    \argument{In order to be able to attenuate the specified frequencies of a signal.}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:Inverse_bandpass_filter_time}
    \requirement{The center frequency must be defined by internal preset.}
    \argument{In order to be able to work in respect to the preset frequency separation of the equalizer.}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:nverse_bandpass_filter_center}
    \requirement{The bandpass filters must, at full amplification, drop to half the amplification, at $\omega = 1.5 \cdot \omega_0$ .}
    \argument{In order to obtain a flat combined frequency response for the equalizer and to be able to amplify or attenuate one band, without effect the neighbouring bands.}
\end{requirement}
