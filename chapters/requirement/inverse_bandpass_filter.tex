\newcommand{\reqInversebandpassfilter}{The delay unit must delay the input signal, in time defined by external unit.}

\reqPrefix{IBF}
\section{Inverse bandpass filter (\reqPrefixName)}
Based on the \autoref{ch:analysing}, the delay requirement is as following

\begin{requirement}\label{req:Inverse_bandpass_filter_ex}
    \requirement{The inverse bandpass filter unit must be able to attenuate the gain in its stopband area}
    \argument{In order to be able to attenuate the the signal gain in specified frequencies}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:Inverse_bandpass_filter_time}
    \requirement{The center frequency must be defined by internal preset}
    \argument{In order to be able to respect the preset frequency separation of the equalizer}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:nverse_bandpass_filter_center}
    \requirement{The bandstop filter cross frequency at \SI{0}{\decibel} shall be at the previously and the next bandstop center frequency in any gain}
    \argument{In order to be able to make a flat frequency respond on the attenuated frequency}
\end{requirement}
