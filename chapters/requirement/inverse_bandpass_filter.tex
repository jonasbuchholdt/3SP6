\section{Inverse bandpass filter (\reqPrefixName)}
Based on the \autoref{ch:analysing}, the Inversed bandpass filter requirements are as following:

\begin{requirement}\label{req:Inverse_bandpass_filter_ex}
    \requirement{The inverse bandpass filter unit must be able to attenuate the gain in its stop-band area}
    \argument{In order to be able to attenuate the the signal gain in specified frequencies}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:Inverse_bandpass_filter_time}
    \requirement{The center frequency must be defined by internal preset}
    \argument{In order to be able to work in respect to the preset frequency separation of the equalizer}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:nverse_bandpass_filter_center}
    \requirement{The bandstop filter cross frequency at \SI{0}{\decibel} must always be at the previous and the next bandstop center frequency at any gain value.}
    \argument{In order to be able to obtain a flat frequency response on the attenuated frequency.}
\end{requirement}
