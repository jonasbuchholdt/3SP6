\newcommand{\reqlfo}{The delay unit must delay the input signal, in time defined by external unit.}

\reqPrefix{LFO}
\section{Low frequency oscillator}
Based on the \autoref{ch:analysing}, the delay requirement is as following

\begin{requirement}\label{req:lfo_ex}
    \requirement{The \gls{lfo} unit must have a frequency from \SI{0.1}{\hertz} to \SI{10}{\hertz}  }
    \argument{In order to be able to make a signal which is under the audibility range. }
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:lfo_time}
    \requirement{The \gls{lfo} unit shall be able to make an sinus, triangle, squared and sawtooth wave forms.}
    \argument{In order to create different chorus, flanger and wah-wah effect}
\end{requirement}
