\reqPrefix{Chorus}
\section{Chorus}
Based on \autoref{ch:analysing}, the following requirements are made for the chorus effect:

\begin{requirement}\label{req:chorus1}
    \requirement{The \gls{lfo} unit must have a frequency from \SI{0.1}{\hertz} to \SI{10}{\hertz}  }
    \argument{In order to be able to make a signal which is under the audibility range. }
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:chorus2}
    \requirement{The \gls{lfo} unit shall be able to make sinus, triangle, squared and sawtooth waveforms.}
    \argument{In order to create different effects like chorus, flanger and wah-wah.}
\end{requirement}
