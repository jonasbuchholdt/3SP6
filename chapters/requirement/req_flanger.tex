\reqPrefix{Flanger}
\section{Flanger}
Based on the \autoref{ch:analysing}, the following requirements are made for the flanger effect:

\begin{requirement}\label{req:flanger1}
    \requirement{The inverse bandpass filter unit must be able to attenuate the gain in its stop-band.}
    \argument{In order to be able to attenuate the specified frequencies of a signal.}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:flanger2}
    \requirement{The center frequency must be defined by internal preset.}
    \argument{In order to be able to work in respect to the preset frequency separation of the equalizer.}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:flanger3}
    \requirement{The bandpass filters must, at full amplification, drop \SI{6}{\decibel} at the neighbouring centerfrequencies .}
    \argument{In order to be able to amplify or attenuate one band, without effect the neighbouring bands.}
\end{requirement}
