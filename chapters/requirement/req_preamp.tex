\section{Pre-Amplifier}

Based on the \autoref{ch:analysing}, the following requirements are made for Pre-Amplifier:

\begin{requirement}\label{req:preamp1}
    \requirement{The Pre-Amplifier must not change the signal amplitude more than 1dB between 20 Hz and 20 kHz}
    \argument{The hearing range for the human being is between 20 Hz and 20 kHz, thus no radical changes between those values means that the user will not feel any difference.}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:preamp2}
    \requirement{The input impedance of the pre-amplifier must be ten times higher than the maximum tested output impedance of the guitar, which means that value will vary according to the used guitar.}
    \argument{To reduce the signal loss between the guitar and the pre-amplifier.}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:preamp3}
    \requirement{The output impedance of the pre-amplifier must be ten times lower than the maximum input impedance of the of the \gls{dsp}, which means that value will vary according to the used \gls{dsp}.}
    \argument{To reduce the signal loss between the \gls{dsp} and the pre-amplifier.}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:preamp4}
    \requirement{The supply for the pre-amplifier must have a maximum supply voltage of \SI{9}{\volt}.}
    \argument{It is based on the fifth basic requirement \ref{req:power2} above which states that the used power supply is \SI{9}{\volt}.}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:preamp5}
    \requirement{The connection between the pre-amplifier and guitar needs to be made with a 6.35 millimeter jack connector(the 6.35 millimeter size is on the guitar side).}
    \argument{This requirement is based on the guitar characteristics.}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:preamp6}
    \requirement{The preamplifier must be able to fit inside the jack connector house.}
    \argument{This requirement is a design choice.}
\end{requirement}
