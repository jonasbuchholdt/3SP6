\section{Test of the Basic requirement}
This section discusses whether the basic requirements stated in section \ref{basic_req} are fulfilled or not. 
In all cases, the requirement \ref{req:dsp} is fulfilled since all the effects are coded in Assembly.


\subsection{Test of the Requirement \autoref{req:speed}}

In the Appendix \ref{app:effect_run_time}, the runtime of the reverb effect, which gives the elapsed time from the moment a new sample arrives until it is loaded for output, has been tested. \\
Figure \ref{fig:reverb_time_test} shows that only 2.5 microseconds are needed to run the effect. \\
Figure \ref{fig:flanger_time_test} shows that the flanger runtime is 2.3 microseconds. \\
The results show that the runtimes of the effects are clearly faster than the sampling time of the \gls{dsp} which is 23 microseconds. \\
It can be concluded that the effects are real-time, faster than the sampling frequency thus the requirement \ref{req:speed} is fulfilled. \\
