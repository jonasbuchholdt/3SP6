In all cases, the requirement \ref{req:dsp} is fulfilled since all the effects are coded in Assembly.


\section{Test of the Reverb Effect}

In this part, tests for the reverb effect that show wether it fulfills the requirement are presented. 

\subsection{Test of the Requirement \ref{req:speed}}

In the Appendix \ref{app:effect_run_time}, the runtime of the reverb effect, which gives the elapsed time from the moment a new sample arrives until it is loaded for output, has been tested. \\
Figure \ref{fig:reverb_time_test} shows that only 2.5 microseconds are needed to run the effect, clearly faster than the sampling time of the \gls{dsp} which is 23 microseconds. It can be concluded that the effect is real-time, faster than the sampling frequency thus the requirement \ref{req:speed} is fullfiled.
